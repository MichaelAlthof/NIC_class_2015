Name of QuantLet:  'NIC_FFTMAFilter'

Published in:      'Numerical Introductory Course - Student Project on "Fast Fourier Transform" '

Description:       'We perform image processing by applying kernel filters using convolution and the fast Fourier 
 	           transform. To do so, we use the 'smoothie' package and its included kernel2dsmooth() package. 
	           We apply these transformations on the image of Mount Rushmore.'

Keywords:          FFT, convolution, kernel smoothing, image processing, filter
