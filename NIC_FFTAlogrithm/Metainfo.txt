Published in:      Numerical Introductory Course - Student Project on ''Fast Fourier Transform''

Description:       'Implementation of a naive Fast Fourier Transform achieving the arithmetic but 
                    cnot the computational complexity of O(N log N).  The following is a Radix-2 
         	          Decimation-in-Time Cooley-Tukey FFT. The supplied data has to have a number 
        	          of observations that is a power of 2; that means, log2(N) is an integer.'

Keywords:          'FFT, complexity, Cooley-Tukey, Radix-2 algorithm, frequency domain, transformation'
