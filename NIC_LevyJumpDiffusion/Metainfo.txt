Published in:      'Numerical Introductory Course - Student Project on ''Simulation of the LÃ©vy processes'' '

Description:       'Simulates a jump diffusion process with drift b and jump intensity lambda. The simulated 
	           process consists of a Gaussian component and a jump component. Additionally, the simulated 
	           data, the gaussian component, the jump components, log returns and the density of log 
	           returns are plotted. '
